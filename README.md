The project implements time-series demand forecasting models, including ARIMA and XGBoost, to optimize inventory levels. This optimization has resulted in a significant 13% reduction in stockouts, ultimately increasing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
# Customer Behavior Analysis and Demand Forecasting

![Project Preview](project_preview.png)

This project is dedicated to understanding customer behavior and optimizing demand forecasting. It has delivered substantial business improvements in customer retention and inventory management. Specifically, it involves two major components:

1. **Customer Behavior Analysis**: This part of the project leverages data mining techniques to uncover valuable customer behavior patterns, leading to a remarkable 15% increase in customer retention.

2. **Demand Forecasting**: The project implements time-series demand forecasting models, including ARIMA and XGBoost, to optimize inventory levels. This effort has successfully reduced stockouts by 13%, contributing to higher operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
